# FOSSGIS course 2019/20 final project 

In recent years, the city of Stuttgart has been in the focus of media interest for excessive lev-els of air pollutants.
Exposure to high concentrations of air pollutants like particulate matter (PM), tropospheric ozone (O3) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can cause a broad spectrum of health issues – particularly of the respiratory system - both in the long and short term.
At the same time, while cycling has no direct adverse effect on the air quality - cyclists themselves are directly
subjected to air pollution within a city, as cycle paths are usually in immediate proximity to roads.
Analyzing and mapping this concentration and distribution of particulate matter - and to map a 'least-polluted' route
through particularly affected areas - is a step to-wards informing about - and protecting users from - air pollution in the city of Stuttgart.

The study will thus concentrate on mapping air pollution within Stuttgart’s central districts Nord, Süd, West, Ost,
Feuerbach and Bad Cannstatt and offering a basic routing service for cyclists.
