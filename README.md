# FOSSGIS course 2019/20 final project 

In recent years, the city of Stuttgart has been in the focus of media interest for excessive levels of air pollutants.
Exposure to high concentrations of air pollutants like particulate matter (PM), tropospheric ozone (O3) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can cause a broad spectrum of health issues – particularly of the respiratory system - both in the long and short term.
At the same time, while cycling has no direct adverse effect on the air quality - cyclists themselves are directly
subjected to air pollution within a city, as cycle paths are usually in immediate proximity to roads.
Analyzing and mapping this concentration and distribution of particulate matter - and to map a 'least-polluted' route
through particularly affected areas - is a step to-wards informing about - and protecting users from - air pollution in the city of Stuttgart.

The study will thus concentrate on mapping air pollution within Stuttgart’s central districts _Nord, Süd, West, Ost, Mitte,
Feuerbach, Botnang, Hedelfingen, Wangen, Münster_ and _Bad Cannstatt_ and additionally offer a basic routing service for cyclists.

For instructions on how to reproduce this study are documented in the [project readme](project/README.md).

The [proposal](proposal/Proposal.pdf) as well as the [presentation](presentation/gis.pdf) are deprecated
because the analysis workflow was enhanced and adjusted.

Results of the analysis are discussed in a [scientific report](report/report.pdf).
